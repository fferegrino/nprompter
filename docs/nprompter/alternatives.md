Alternatives to Nprompter
===============

nprompter is not the only browser-based teleprompter, in fact, I know many of them since I started using them myself before deciding to crear this tool. Among the many alternatives I found these to bee good:

 * [CuePrompter.com](https://cueprompter.com/) 
 * [Teleprompter Mirror](https://telepromptermirror.com/)
 * [Teleprompter online](https://www.teleprompter-online.com/)
 * [Veed.io](https://www.veed.io/tools/teleprompter)

Though they are good, their functionality is limited to the teleprompter part, one has to store and edit the scripts somewhere else.
