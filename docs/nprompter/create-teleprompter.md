# Create a teleprompter

A professional teleprompter runs on the market for thousands of pounds, however there is an easy and relatively cheap way to create your own. For example, I have mine set up using:

 * A [single monitor arm](https://amzn.to/3fWlX3M),
 * a [cheap teleprompter](https://amzn.to/3CMt9Iz),
 * and a [7" screen](https://amzn.to/3ers2EN).

Which in total was a fraction of the cost of buying a professional one, here are some pictures of my setup:
