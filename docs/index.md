Welcome to Nprompter's documentation!
=====================================

 > nprompter is a browser-based teleprompter powered by a Notion's backend to edit and store scripts.

Here is how it looks:

This is useful for people who want to create videos and need a teleprompter to read from, and are active users of the Notion platform. nprompter allows you to create and edit scripts directly in Notion, and then use them in the teleprompter.
